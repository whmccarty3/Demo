# Data Engineering Demonstration
Will McCarty

Welcome!  
This project works by querying the National Institute of Health's database
of medical literature (PubMED), storing documents for fast analysis,
and performing a combination of rule-based and predictive searches
to look for connections (or "bridges") between two different medical 
knowledge domains. This idea for a big-data oreinted medical research
tool came from my time doing research with Dr. Joseph Marr at GMU.

Packages: pymed, pymongo, spacy, time

Hard coded database: mongodb://localhost:27017

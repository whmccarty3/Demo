Data Engineering Demonstration

Welcome! This idea for a big- data oreinted medical research tool
came from my time doing research with Dr. Joseph Marr at GMU. 
It works by querying the National Institute of Health's database
of medical literature (PubMED), storing documents for fast analysis,
and performing a combination of verbose and predictive searches
for connections (or "bridges") between two different medical 
knowledge domains. 

Packages: pymed, pymongo, spacy, time
